Stephen Kuhl and Kabeer Chopra decided to start Burrow when they saw friends paying to have their couches cut apart in order to get them up narrow New York City apartment stairwells. Burrow helps eliminate the pain points of purchasing a couch and is specifically designed to support its customers as their lives evolve.
The company has been featured in the NY Times, TechCrunch, Inc. (magazine), and The Macro.

With an emphasis on unique forms, exquisite artistry, and fine materials, Maiden Home articulates designs that reflect a contemporary point of view and a distinctive allure. The house was founded in 2017 by Nidhi Kapur, who guides the evolution of the collections from its Tribeca design studio.</p></DD>

<p><DD>Maiden Home was founded by entrepreneur Nidhi Kapur. After purchasing her first home as a newlywed, she began looking for high-quality furniture offered at a price and level of transparency that she had come to expect from modern retailers. After failing to find this on the market, she founded Maiden Home in order to deliver designer-quality pieces at a value and speed that was missing on the market. 
Kapur began her career at McKinsey as a consultant, after which she worked at Google, and then at Birchbox as the Director of Business Development before launching Maiden Home. 
Maiden Home follows the direct-to-consumer business model, allowing her craftsmen partners to access an entirely new market they had previously not sold through. By eliminating the intermediaries and third-parties (including showrooms and traditional retailers), Maiden Home is able to deliver the same high quality pieces at a lower price and faster pace.</p></DD>s
