<p><DD>Rooms To Go was founded in 1990 by Jeffrey and Morty Seaman after selling Seaman's Furniture. They opened the first Rooms To Go in Orlando, Florida on September 7, 1990. Rooms To Go's founding concept was the sale of whole room packages, using the slogan: "Buy the piece, save a little. Buy the room, save a lot!" Furniture was offered in predesigned rooms, targeted at consumers looking to save both time and money without sacrificing quality. Jeffrey Seaman, who took the lead in developing the concept, envisioned a merchandising approach reflecting successful trends in other sectors of retail, such as bright, colorful stores with large glass walls and a friendly atmosphere. Stores were designed with an open layout so that customers could view the merchandise from multiple vantage points. The company also used an advanced computer system to manage inventory flow.</p></DD>

<p><DD>By 1996, Rooms To Go had become Florida's fastest-growing furniture retailer. In order to avoid saturating the Florida market, Rooms To Go expanded into Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chattanooga and Nashville, Tennessee. In 1998, Rooms To Go expanded into Texas, a move that led to a 20 percent growth in revenue from the previous year</p></DD>
